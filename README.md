# Etica.AI Infrastructure Logbook++

This repository is the very first one on Etica.AI about document how we
configured VPSs and containers for our usage. Since 2017 things get much more
complex than a single repository could contain all information. So as 2019
we use several repositories and not all them are on the EticaAI organization
at this moment.
